# Develop a React App with Typescript that uses the Genesys Cloud Platform SDK

![React App Flowchart](blueprint/images/flowchart.png)

## Description

This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint demonstrates how to integrate the Genesys Cloud Javascript Platform SDK into a React app. This solution uses Typescript, although the implementation will be similar if you're using plain JavaScript.  This solution includes a sample React app that explores use cases such as creating a profile page for a user and completing admin operations such as signing all the users out of a queue.
